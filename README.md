## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
Our proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management and Biosecurity Portal — a centralized web and mobile platform that helps pig and poultry farmers effectively manage farm biosecurity through digital tools and guidance.

Key Features

Farm Biosecurity Risk Assessment:
AI-based questionnaire that assesses disease risk based on farm size, layout, livestock population, and local outbreak data.

Interactive Dashboard:
Real-time farm health monitoring, notifications on disease outbreaks, and compliance score tracking.

Training & Awareness Modules:
Gamified and multilingual e-learning modules covering cleaning, vaccination, and safe animal transport.

Regulatory Compliance Tracker:
Auto-generated digital records and reports to meet Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying standards.

Farmer-Veterinarian Connect:
Direct chat and video consultation options for farmers to connect with registered veterinarians.

Offline Functionality:
Core features accessible without internet—important for rural and low-connectivity regions.

Analytics for Policy Makers:
Aggregated and anonymized data insights to help authorities track disease trends and manage responses efficiently.

## Technical Approach
Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js (Web), Flutter (Mobile App)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: MongoDB (for flexibility)

Cloud Services: AWS / Google Cloud for hosting and analytics

AI/ML: Python (Scikit-learn) for risk assessment model

APIs: GIS and weather APIs for region-based disease prediction

Security: JWT authentication, HTTPS, and role-based access control

System Workflow

User Registration: Farmers, veterinarians, and officials register and log in.

Farm Setup: Users enter details about farm type, livestock count, and biosecurity measures.

Risk Assessment Engine: System analyzes data and assigns a “Biosecurity Score.”

Recommendations: Generates tailored preventive measures and training modules.

Monitoring Dashboard: Displays alerts, health logs, and compliance records.

Data Analytics Module: Authorities access anonymized reports for disease surveillance.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

Technical: Based on existing web and mobile frameworks; integration with real-time APIs is achievable.

Operational: Designed for low-cost scalability; supports regional languages for inclusivity.

Economic: Open-source components reduce development costs; potential funding via government grants and CSR programs.

Potential Challenges

Limited digital literacy among rural farmers.

Connectivity issues in remote areas.

Need for continuous data updates on disease outbreaks.

Mitigation Strategies

Simplified UI with icons and voice guidance.

Offline mode with local caching.

Collaboration with veterinary departments for verified, real-time data feeds.

## Impact and Benefits
Impact on Target Audience

Farmers: Access to biosecurity tools, personalized guidance, and faster response to disease threats.

Veterinarians: Simplified data collection, reporting, and farmer outreach.

Government & Researchers: Centralized data for surveillance, prediction, and policy planning.

Social, Economic & Environmental Benefits

Social: Empowers small and marginal farmers with accessible digital support.

Economic: Reduces financial losses from disease outbreaks through early intervention.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable and responsible livestock practices, minimizing waste and contamination.
